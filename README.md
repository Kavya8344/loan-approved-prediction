# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction System

A Machine Learning powered web application that predicts whether a loan application is likely to be approved based on applicant financial information.

Built using **Python, Flask, Scikit-Learn, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Loan Approval Prediction System helps evaluate loan eligibility using Machine Learning algorithms trained on applicant financial data.

The system analyzes:

- 💰 Income
- 📈 Credit Score
- 🏦 Loan Amount
- 💼 Years Employed

and predicts whether the loan application is:

✅ Approved

or

❌ Rejected

The application also maintains a prediction history for previously submitted applications.
